OK, so lets think about our approach here.

I think we're going to create a new type of card - GamerCard.  The GamerCard is going to be gamepad friendly.  
- It doesn't rush to log you in if you're a nopasswdlogin user
- If you hit X it logs you in
- If you hit Y it brings up the session menu
  - The user's session is shown to the right of their name with a session icon, like Slick Greeter
  - pressing up or down on the right stick or D-pad changes the selected user session
  - pressing X selects the currently-highlighted user session
  - pressing B dismisses the session menu without changing the selection
  * defer this functionality for now - I'd just like to get something useful working


Using the "back" button reveals the non-GamerCard users  The "back" button is a toggle to shuffle
the non GamerCard users in or out of the user list.  Non-GamerCard users are presented with a regular UserCard.
* for now just reveal all the non-GamerCard users

The "start" button brings up the Restart/Shutdown menu, like in Slick Greeter.
- Left joystick or D-pad {Left, Right} changes between the options
- Pressing the X button activates the currently selected option
- pressing the "start" button again, or the "B" button dismisses the menu with no action taken
* defer for now; we can shutdown from within Steam for the time being

--------------------------------------------

So, now that I have a sort of serious plan, I think I should take proper measures on this thing.  

So, lets checkout 5.0.4.  Delete everything.  Rename the project.  Add something to the README.md to acknowledge
elementary OS and the original authors as an upstream fork.

Then start coding this like I mean it.  So we'll get that code in to check for nopasswdlogin users, and create
a GamerCard, initially the same as the other user cards.  But we'll dump a message so we know we loaded the other
type of card.
